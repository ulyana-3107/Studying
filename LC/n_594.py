# We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is
# exactly 1. Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible
# subsequences. A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements
# without changing the order of the remaining elements.
